# What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Example

Here is how you can use a component:

```jsx
import { Chart } from './components/Chart'

<Chart />
```

It makes writing long-form content with rich interactivity a breeze.
